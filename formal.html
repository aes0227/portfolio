                    <p> 
                        In previous years, residents didn't have a centralized 
                        place to easily find information about events such as Formal, which involves 
                        10 residential colleges at Northwestern University. My role was to bridge this 
                        gap and facilitate <strong>cross-communication</strong> between the Communication and Public Relations 
                        officers of each RC.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <h3> The Website Plan</h3>
                    <div class="col">
                        <img src="images/formal/web.png">

                        <p>The solution: A website page within the current site for RCB.
                        As a result, this page could be <strong>accessible</strong> during any part of the customer
                        journey, whether that be directly through the website or from other owned media like
                        social media using linkr.ee/nurcb.

                        <p> Limitations: The link to purchase a ticket had to be sent through private 
                            channels, i.e. emails and residential college group chats, 
                            as this was a members only event.

                    <p> <br>
                        With the help of the officers from each Residential College, I was 
                        able to engage with a wider audience on social media through their 
                        instagram accounts by tagging, commenting, reposting.

                            <li> <strong>Word-of-Mouth:</strong> I encouraged Communication officers of
                                 each RC to ask residents whether they got a ticket to 
                                 Formal at smaller events being held during the sales period.

                            <br>
                            <li>I helped create a sense of urgency as each RC was only allocated a 
                                percentage of tickets, which resulted in three RCs selling 
                                out in the first three days and others following behind.

                <h3>Personal Takeaways</h3>
                <p>  While working on this project, I was taking a digital media strategy class which helped me to 
                    apply those learnings about target audeinces to the implementation of creative assets.

                    My team of executive board members were a big part of pulling off this large event.
                    For many of us it was our first time contributing and leading at such a large scale. 
                    I was greatful for all the support and feeback for every step of the process.
